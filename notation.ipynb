    "One key problem when dealing with medical codes, is how to describe a group of codes that make up a disease in a short and efficient manner. For instance, there are many dozens of codes that belong under the general category of liver disease. Listing all codes every time we want to select a group of patients with a given conditions, becomes very cumbersome. Instead, we will develop a notation where you can use stars, hyphens and colons to describe sets of medical codes, and functions that expand the shorthand codes to the full set of codes.\n",

Repeatedly constructing a list of codes from information in columns might be time consuming with large dataframes, and we should be careful to do it in the most efficient manner possible. Also, using the existing codes to define a list of codes, might not identify all possible codes. Instead it will only identify all those codes that have been used in the data. Expansion using 'all codes in my data' as opposed 'all codes in the official codebook' may produce different results. For many purposes we only want a list of those codes that actually exist in the data - and including irrelevant codes would just make things slower. But it is a difference one should be aware of.\n",

Instad of only allowing the user to search for everything that starts with a given pattern,  one might allow searching for all codes that end with a given string, for instance everything that ends with **B3*. Even more advanced, one could allow stars in the middle: Searching for codes that start with something and end with something. Finally, if more advanced searches are desired, we could allow expansion based on a regex pattern i.e. include those codes in a codelist that conform to a pattern described by a regex expression. Lastly, there might be codes that actually have stars and hyphens as part of the code itself - in which case we have to be careful not to expand the codes as if the hyphen or star were notational symbols (for instance by introducing a *raw=True* argument to indicate that the codes should not be expanded).\n",
